## Overview

FlagEvalMM is an open-source evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess multimodal models. It provides a standardized way to evaluate models that work with multiple modalities (text, images, video) across various tasks and metrics.

## News

- [2025-09-02] Supported by FlagEvalMM, [LRM-Eval](https://github.com/flageval-baai/LRM-Eval) is released. We include the evaluation code of [ROME](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/ROME) in the tasks/rome directory. We recommend using llm-judge for diagrams evaluation and rule-based evaluation for other tasks with prepared configs in the tasks/rome directory.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for multiple multimodal models and evaluation tasks, including: VQA, image retrieval, text-to-image, etc.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks and Metrics**: Support new and commonly used benchmarks and metrics.
- **Extensive Model Support**: The model_zoo provides inference support for a wide range of popular multimodal models including QWenVL and LLaVA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with API-based models such as GPT, Claude, and HuanYuan.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily extendable to incorporate new models, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.
